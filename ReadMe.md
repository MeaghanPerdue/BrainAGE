## Created by Meaghan Perdue
## 03-14-2025
This project tests performance of BrainAGE (age-gap-estimate) prediction models on MRI data acquired from adolescents born very preterm and comparison group of full-term born children/adolescents from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) cohort participants scanned at UMass Chan Medical School (PING site: UMMS).

Project under development.
