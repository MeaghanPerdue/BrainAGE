This project tests performance of BrainAGE (age-gap-estimate) prediction models on MRI data acquired from adolescents born very preterm.

Project under development.

## BrainAGE model
First set of models test Global-BrainAGE model: <https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAge_global>
Inputs: Freesurfer 6.0.0 D-K parcellation and subcortical segmentation data
